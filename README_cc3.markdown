# CSC220 Coding Challenge 3: Prime Pantry
## Objective: 

## Installation and set-up
- Download the file and run it in Python 3. 
- Note: This pragram is written with regard to Python 3, so you might want to run it in Python 3!

## Running the tests
- Input: a file with a dictionary, the num of items, the max total
- Output: subsets of the items which can add up to the max total, or are closed to the max total without going over it

### Example 1 

### Example 2

## Efficiency test
Since for every item we loop through the previous items to see what number we can get, the worset O is about O(n^2) for n num of items
